## About Frontend

"This is a frontend project for a personal portfolio application. It is built using React as the primary JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The development server and build tool is Vite, indicating a modern and fast development setup. The project is primarily written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and improved code quality. For styling, it utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. Dependencies are managed using npm, as indicated by `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. The application's entry point is `index.html` in the `public` directory, and the main application logic resides within the `src/` directory, which likely contains React components, hooks, and other related modules. The project also includes ESLint for code linting and standard TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`). The `.gitignore` file indicates standard exclusions for a Node.js/React project."
